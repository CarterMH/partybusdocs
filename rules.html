            <div class="subheading">Detailed Rule Explanations</div>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 1: ACARS Flight Logging</strong></p>
            <p>All flights must be logged using the ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System). The ACARS system automatically tracks flight data including departure time, arrival time, flight duration, distance flown, fuel consumption, altitude profile, speed profile, and landing performance parameters. Manual flight logs are not accepted. Flights not logged through ACARS will not be counted toward flight hour requirements or activity requirements. The ACARS system must be started before engine start and remain active throughout the flight until engine shutdown. ACARS connection must be verified before beginning flight operations. In the event of ACARS failure during flight, the pilot must report the failure to technical support and may be required to provide manual flight data for verification purposes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 2: Minimum Activity Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots must complete a minimum of three (3) flights per calendar month to maintain active status. A flight is defined as a completed flight from departure to arrival that has been successfully logged through ACARS. Flights that are aborted, incomplete, or not logged do not count toward the activity requirement. The activity requirement is calculated on a monthly basis from the first day of the calendar month through the last day of the calendar month. Pilots who do not meet the minimum activity requirement will be automatically placed on inactive status at the beginning of the following month. Inactive pilots retain their pilot ID and rank but lose access to certain privileges including route scheduling and participation in special events. Pilots may request reactivation by completing three flights within a single month and contacting the operations manager.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 3: ATC Compliance</strong></p>
            <p>When flying online with air traffic control services (such as VATSIM or IVAO), pilots must follow all ATC instructions and clearances. This includes altitude assignments, heading assignments, speed restrictions, route clearances, frequency changes, and any other instructions issued by ATC. Failure to comply with ATC instructions may result in disciplinary action. Pilots must use proper radio phraseology and procedures when communicating with ATC. All ATC clearances and instructions must be read back to confirm understanding. If a pilot cannot comply with an ATC instruction, they must inform ATC immediately and request an alternative clearance. Pilots must also comply with published departure, arrival, and approach procedures when ATC is not providing vectors.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 4: Radio Communications</strong></p>
            <p>All radio communications must use standard aviation phraseology as established by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). Pilots must use the phonetic alphabet for call signs and critical information. Communications must be professional, clear, and concise. Standard phraseology must be used for all transmissions including position reports, altitude reports, frequency changes, and readbacks. Non-standard terminology, slang, or casual language is prohibited. All clearances, instructions, and frequency changes must be read back. Radio communications must be conducted in English unless otherwise specified. When multiple aircraft are using the same frequency, pilots must listen before transmitting and avoid unnecessary transmissions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 5: Realistic Flight Parameters</strong></p>
            <p>All flight operations must maintain realistic parameters throughout all phases of flight. Aircraft must not exceed maximum operating speeds (Vmo/Mmo) or structural limitations. Climb rates must be realistic for the aircraft type and weight. Descent rates must not exceed normal operating parameters (typically 1500-2500 feet per minute). Flight times must be consistent with aircraft performance capabilities and route distances. Fuel consumption must match aircraft specifications and flight conditions. Landing rates must not exceed -600 feet per minute. Takeoff distances must be realistic for aircraft weight and runway conditions. Pilots must not use unrealistic acceleration, deceleration, or maneuvering capabilities. Any modification of flight simulator settings that results in unrealistic aircraft performance is prohibited.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 6: Professional Conduct</strong></p>
            <p>All pilots must treat fellow pilots, staff members, and external contacts with respect and professionalism at all times. This includes all forms of communication including but not limited to radio communications, forum posts, email communications, and in-game interactions. Harassment, discrimination, intimidation, or abusive behavior is strictly prohibited. Pilots must maintain appropriate behavior in all PartyBus VA related activities and communications. Disputes or disagreements must be handled through appropriate channels and in a professional manner. Public disputes, arguments, or confrontations are not permitted.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 7: Technical Issue Reporting</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots are required to report technical issues, system malfunctions, software problems, or other technical difficulties that may affect flight operations or data accuracy. Technical issues should be reported to the technical support department via email at support@partybus.org. Reports should include detailed information about the issue, steps to reproduce the problem, error messages (if any), screenshots when applicable, system specifications, and any other relevant information. Critical technical issues that prevent flight operations should be reported immediately. Non-critical issues may be reported within 48 hours. Pilots should not attempt to resolve technical issues through unauthorized means or modifications to approved systems.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 8: Account Security</strong></p>
            <p>Pilot IDs and account credentials are personal and confidential. Pilots must not share their pilot ID, password, or any account information with other individuals. Each pilot must maintain their own account and may not allow others to use their account. Pilots are responsible for all activity conducted under their pilot ID. If a pilot suspects unauthorized access to their account, they must report it immediately to the administration department. Pilots must use strong passwords and maintain password security. Sharing accounts or pilot IDs violates security policies and may result in immediate suspension or termination of membership for all parties involved.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 9: Route Adherence</strong></p>
            <p>All flights must follow the planned route as specified in the flight plan. Pilots may deviate from the planned route only in the following circumstances: (1) when directed by ATC, (2) when required for weather avoidance, (3) when necessary for safety reasons, or (4) when approved in advance by operations management. Significant route deviations must be documented and reported. Pilots must follow published departure procedures, en-route waypoints, arrival procedures, and approach procedures as specified in the route database and charts. Custom routes may be approved on a case-by-case basis but must be requested and approved before flight. Route changes made during flight due to ATC instructions are acceptable but should be noted in the flight log.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rule 10: Realistic Flight Times and Speeds</strong></p>
            <p>Flight times must be consistent with aircraft performance capabilities, route distance, wind conditions, and operational procedures. Typical cruise speeds for A319/A320/A321 aircraft range from Mach 0.78 to Mach 0.82. Flight times must account for climb time, cruise time, and descent time based on realistic performance parameters. For example, a 500 nautical mile flight in an A320 should typically take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours block time depending on climb and descent profiles. Pilots must not use excessive speeds that would result in unrealistic flight times. Fuel consumption must also be consistent with flight time and aircraft specifications. Any flight times or speeds that appear unrealistic will be reviewed and may result in the flight not being counted toward requirements.</p>

            <div class="subheading">Flight Conduct Rules</div>
            
            <p><strong>Aircraft Configuration</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots must use approved aircraft configurations as provided by PartyBus VA. Aircraft must be configured with proper PartyBus VA liveries. Modifications to aircraft configurations that affect flight performance, systems modeling, or data accuracy are prohibited. Pilots must use the correct aircraft variant (A319, A320, or A321) as specified for each route. Aircraft weight must be within specified limits and appropriate for the flight conditions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Flight Profile Standards</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots must maintain realistic flight profiles throughout all phases of flight. Takeoff must follow standard procedures with appropriate rotation speed, climb speed, and acceleration. Cruise flight must maintain assigned altitude within specified tolerances (+/- 100 feet) and use appropriate cruise speeds. Descent must be initiated at appropriate points and maintain realistic descent rates. Approach and landing must follow standard procedures with proper configuration and approach speeds. Go-arounds must be executed when necessary and follow proper procedures.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Landing Performance Standards</strong></p>
            <p>All landings must meet specified performance standards. Landing rate must not exceed -600 feet per minute. Touchdown must occur within the first 3000 feet of runway. Centerline deviation must not exceed 20 feet. Airspeed at touchdown must be within 5 knots of target approach speed. Landings that do not meet these standards will be flagged for review. Repeated violations of landing performance standards may result in additional training requirements or disciplinary action.</p>
            
            <p><strong>ATC Compliance Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>When flying online with ATC services, pilots must comply with all ATC instructions without exception. This includes but is not limited to altitude assignments, heading assignments, speed restrictions, route clearances, frequency changes, hold instructions, and approach clearances. Pilots must read back all clearances and instructions to confirm understanding. If unable to comply with an instruction, pilots must inform ATC immediately and request alternative clearance. Failure to comply with ATC instructions may result in immediate suspension pending review.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Radio Communication Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>All radio communications must use standard ICAO phraseology. Communications must be professional, clear, and concise. Standard formats must be used for position reports, altitude reports, and other transmissions. The phonetic alphabet must be used for call signs and critical information. Readbacks are required for all clearances and instructions. Communications must be conducted in English unless otherwise specified. Unnecessary transmissions should be avoided.</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <div class="subheading">Activity Requirements</div>
            
            <p><strong>Monthly Activity Minimum</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots must complete a minimum of three (3) flights per calendar month to maintain active status. A flight is considered complete when it has been flown from departure to arrival and successfully logged through ACARS. The activity requirement is calculated monthly from the first day of the calendar month through the last day of the calendar month. Activity is tracked automatically by the ACARS system.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Activity Calculation</strong></p>
            <p>Only completed flights that are successfully logged through ACARS count toward activity requirements. Flights that are aborted, incomplete, or not logged do not count. The activity requirement is based on the number of flights completed, not flight hours. Multiple flights may be completed on the same day to meet the requirement. Activity is calculated automatically by the system at the end of each calendar month.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Inactive Status</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots who do not meet the minimum activity requirement will be automatically placed on inactive status at the beginning of the following month. Inactive pilots retain their pilot ID, rank, and flight hours but lose access to certain privileges including route scheduling, special events, and promotional activities. Inactive status continues until the pilot completes three flights within a single calendar month and requests reactivation through the operations manager.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Activity Exceptions</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots may request exceptions to the activity requirement for extenuating circumstances such as extended absence, medical issues, or other valid reasons. Exception requests must be submitted to the operations manager at least one week before the end of the month. Exceptions are granted on a case-by-case basis and may include temporary inactive status without loss of privileges or extended grace periods. Pilots granted exceptions must still meet activity requirements when they return to active flying.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Communication Response Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots must respond to communications from staff members within seven (7) days. This includes email communications, forum messages, and other official communications. Failure to respond to staff communications may result in account suspension or other disciplinary action. Pilots are responsible for maintaining current email addresses and checking communications regularly. Important communications may be sent via email, forum, or through the main website.</p>
            
            <div class="info">
              <strong>Activity Monitoring:</strong> Activity is monitored automatically. Pilots can view their current month's activity through their pilot profile on the main website. Activity status is updated in real-time as flights are completed and logged.

            <div class="subheading">Disciplinary Actions</div>
            
            <p><strong>Progressive Discipline System</strong></p>
            <p>PartyBus VA uses a progressive discipline system designed to address violations while providing opportunities for improvement. Disciplinary actions are assigned based on the severity of the violation, the pilot's history, and other relevant factors.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Verbal Warning</strong></p>
            <p>Minor violations or first-time infractions may result in a verbal warning. Verbal warnings are documented and communicated to the pilot via email. Verbal warnings serve as notice that a violation has occurred and that future violations may result in more serious disciplinary action. Verbal warnings do not restrict pilot privileges but are noted in the pilot's record.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Written Warning</strong></p>
            <p>More serious violations or repeated minor violations may result in a written warning. Written warnings are formal documents that outline the violation, the applicable rules, and the consequences of future violations. Written warnings are placed in the pilot's permanent record and may restrict certain privileges temporarily. Pilots receiving written warnings may be required to complete additional training or corrective action.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Temporary Suspension</strong></p>
            <p>Serious violations or repeated violations may result in temporary suspension. Suspension periods range from one (1) to thirty (30) days depending on the severity of the violation. During suspension, pilots lose all privileges including the ability to log flights, schedule routes, and participate in activities. Suspended pilots retain their pilot ID and rank but cannot accumulate flight hours or activity during the suspension period. Suspension periods are calculated in calendar days.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Permanent Suspension</strong></p>
            <p>Very serious violations or repeated serious violations may result in permanent suspension. Permanently suspended pilots lose all privileges permanently and cannot be reinstated. Permanent suspension is reserved for the most serious violations including but not limited to account sharing, data falsification, harassment, or repeated violations after multiple warnings and temporary suspensions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
            <p>Termination of membership is the most severe disciplinary action and results in permanent removal from PartyBus VA. Termination may occur immediately for the most serious violations or after other disciplinary actions have failed to correct behavior. Terminated pilots lose all privileges, flight hours, rank, and access to PartyBus VA systems permanently.</p>
            
            <div class="subheading">Appeals Process</div>
            
            <p><strong>Right to Appeal</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots have the right to appeal disciplinary actions they believe are unjustified. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the operations manager at ops@partybus.org within seven (7) days of receiving notice of the disciplinary action. Appeals must include the reason for the appeal, relevant facts, and any supporting documentation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Appeal Review Process</strong></p>
            <p>Appeals are reviewed by operations management and administration. The appeal review process typically takes 5-10 business days. During the appeal review, the disciplinary action remains in effect. If the appeal is successful, the disciplinary action may be reversed or modified. If the appeal is denied, the original disciplinary action stands. The decision of the appeal review is final.</p>

            <p><strong>Automated Monitoring</strong></p>
            <p>PartyBus VA uses automated systems to monitor compliance with rules and regulations. Flight data, activity levels, and performance parameters are tracked automatically through the ACARS system. Automated alerts are generated for potential violations including unrealistic flight parameters, landing performance issues, and activity deficiencies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Manual Review</strong></p>
            <p>In addition to automated monitoring, staff members conduct manual reviews of flight data, pilot activity, and compliance with procedures. Manual reviews may be triggered by automated alerts, pilot reports, or random selection. Manual reviews examine flight logs, performance data, route adherence, and other factors to ensure compliance with all rules and regulations.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Violation Reporting</strong></p>
            <p>Pilots may report suspected rule violations by other pilots. Violation reports should be submitted to the operations manager with detailed information about the suspected violation including dates, times, pilot IDs, and specific details. All reports are investigated thoroughly and confidentially. Retaliation against pilots who report violations is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate suspension.</p>
            
            <div class="warning">
              <strong>Enforcement:</strong> All rules and regulations are enforced consistently and fairly. Pilots are expected to be familiar with all rules and comply with them. Ignorance of rules is not an acceptable defense for violations.
