            <div class="subheading">1. Flight Scheduling Procedures</div>
            <p>All flights must be scheduled through the PartyBus VA flight scheduling system. Available routes are listed in the <a href="route-database.html">route database</a>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Route Selection Criteria:</strong></p>
            <p>Route selection must comply with the following criteria. Routes must be selected exclusively from the approved route database maintained by PartyBus VA operations department. The route database contains all approved routes with detailed information including departure airport identifier (ICAO code), arrival airport identifier (ICAO code), route distance in nautical miles, typical flight time in hours and minutes, recommended aircraft type, and route-specific notes or restrictions. Aircraft type selected for the route must match the route requirements as specified in the route database. Aircraft variants (A319, A320, A321) must be appropriate for the route distance and payload requirements. Flight distance must be realistic for the selected aircraft variant based on aircraft range capabilities and typical operations. The route must be currently available in the scheduling system and not restricted or suspended. Routes marked as seasonal or conditional must only be selected when conditions are met. Custom routes not in the database require prior approval from operations management and must be submitted through the proper channels at least 72 hours in advance of the proposed flight.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Detailed Scheduling Process:</strong></p>
            <p>The flight scheduling process consists of the following sequential steps which must be completed in order:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Access the route database through the main website or documentation site. The route database is available as a downloadable Excel file or through the online route search interface.</li>
              <li>Review available routes and filter by aircraft type, distance range, departure region, or arrival region as needed to identify suitable routes.</li>
              <li>Select an appropriate route based on aircraft availability, personal preference, route characteristics, and operational requirements. Consider factors such as route distance, estimated flight time, airport characteristics, and route popularity.</li>
              <li>Verify all route details including departure airport ICAO code (must be confirmed against current airport database), arrival airport ICAO code (must be confirmed against current airport database), route distance in nautical miles (verify against navigation calculations), estimated flight time in hours and minutes (calculated based on typical cruise speed and route distance), recommended aircraft variant (must match available aircraft), and any route-specific notes or restrictions.</li>
              <li>Check aircraft availability in the scheduling system to ensure the selected aircraft variant is available for the proposed flight time. Aircraft availability may be limited during peak hours or for popular routes.</li>
              <li>Schedule the flight in the system by entering the route identifier, aircraft variant, proposed departure time (in UTC), pilot ID, and any special requests or notes. The system will confirm availability and assign a scheduled departure time.</li>
              <li>Note the scheduled departure time, flight number assignment, route identifier, and any special instructions provided by the system. This information should be recorded for reference during flight operations.</li>
              <li>Review the scheduled flight details to ensure accuracy before proceeding with flight preparation. Verify all information is correct including route, aircraft, and scheduled time.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Scheduling Time Requirements:</strong></p>
            <p>Flights must be scheduled at least one (1) hour in advance of the proposed departure time. This advance scheduling requirement allows time for system processing, aircraft availability confirmation, and flight preparation. Last-minute scheduling requests (less than one hour before departure) may not be accepted by the system and are discouraged. Pilots should plan their flight schedules in advance to ensure availability and proper processing. Scheduled flights may be cancelled or modified up to 30 minutes before the scheduled departure time without penalty. Cancellations or modifications within 30 minutes of scheduled departure may be subject to review.</p>
            
            <div class="info">
              <strong>Scheduling System Availability:</strong> The flight scheduling system is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Scheduled maintenance windows are announced in advance on the forum and main website. During maintenance windows, scheduling may be unavailable. Pilots should plan accordingly.
